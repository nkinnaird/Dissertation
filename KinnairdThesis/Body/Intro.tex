\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter:Introduction}

The prevailing theory of particle physics, the Standard Model (SM), has had tremendous success in describing our universe. It has been used to predict and explain a wide variety of phenomena, particles, properties, and interactions to great precision. However, in spite of its success in explaining nearly all experimental results, there remain unanswered questions about our universe. Some of these include the matter-antimatter asymmetry, the source of mass for the neutrinos, the existence of dark matter, and an inability to fully incorporate our best theory of gravitation. Many particle physics experiments around the world are being devised and conducted in order to shed light on these questions and improve our understanding of reality. One such experiment is the Fermilab Muon \gmtwo Experiment (E989) underway at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) located in Batavia, Illinois.

I have been a part of the E989 experiment since I began my graduate degree six years ago. This dissertation will describe the E989 experiment and the work which I have done for it in detail. Chapter 1 will provide experimental and theoretical background to the experiment, as well its motivation. Chapter 2 will describe the experimental principle and specifics of muon production and storage. Chapter 3 will describe the various detector systems. Chapter 4 will describe the straw tracking reconstruction including the track fitting algorithm that I developed, as well as some analysis results. Chapter 5 will describe the precession frequency measurement portion of the experiment, and detail my analysis results from data taken in the experiment's first run in 2018. Chapter 6 will conclude the thesis and the results contained within.


\section{Magnetic moments of particles}
\label{sec:MDMs}

In order to understand the purpose of the Fermilab Muon \gmtwo Experiment, first we need to understand the meaning of the $g$ in \gmtwo. This is what the experiment is measuring. All particles have intrinsic properties. One property of charged particles is the magnetic dipole moment.\footnote{\textit{Magnetic dipole moment} and \textit{magnetic moment} are equivalent when talking about particles.} This property of a particle is related to its spin through the equation
		\begin{align}
            \vec{\mu} = g \frac{q}{2m} \vec{s},
        \label{eq:magneticmoment}
		\end{align}
where $\vec{\mu}$ is the magnetic dipole moment of a particle, $\vec{s}$ is its spin vector, $m$ is its mass, $q = \pm e$ where $e$ is the elementary charge, and \g is the so called ``Land\'{e} g-factor''. \g is a measurable and predictable constant. Since the torque on a particle in a magnetic field is 
		\begin{align}
            \vec{N} = \vec{\mu} \times \vec{B},
        \label{eq:torque}
		\end{align}
the rate at which a particles spin precesses in a magnetic field will depend on \g. This is one of the key physics principles in the E989 experiment as will be discussed later.

In a Dirac theory, \g is equal to 2 for spin-\textonehalf\xspace particles with no internal structure \cite{Dirac}. See Appendix~\ref{gDirac} for a derivation of this result. It turns out however, that in reality \g is not quite equal to 2 even for these types of particles. Motivated by early experimental discrepancies such as the measurements of the hyperfine structure in hydrogen \cite{EarlyHyperfine1}, in 1948 Schwinger calculated the first ``radiative correction'' to the electron magnetic moment \cite{Schwinger}. In a quantum field theory, interactions of the particle with virtual particles in loops will contribute to the value of \g. In this context it is convenient to recast the magnetic dipole moment formula as 
		\begin{equation}
		\begin{aligned}
            \vec{\mu} &= 2(1+a) \frac{q}{2m} \vec{s}, \\
            a &= \frac{g-2}{2},
        \label{eq:anamoly}
		\end{aligned}
		\end{equation}
where $a$ is called the ``magnetic anomaly,'' and contains all higher order corrections to \g. The first correction calculated to $a$ by Schwinger was $a = \alpha/2\pi \approx 0.00116$, where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant. By measuring $a$, the SM theory can be tested and extensions to it constrained. A precise measurement of the magnetic anomaly, or the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, is the main goal of the Fermilab Muon \gmtwo Experiment.


\section{Standard Model contributions to \amu}
\label{sec:Theory}

Any complete theory must agree with experimental observations. The latest theoretical predictions for the muon magnetic moment will be presented here. The contributions to \amu can be summed from separate pieces relating to different parts of the SM. These include the quantum-electrodynamics (QED) corrections purely from other leptons and photons, the electroweak (EW) corrections from interactions with the weak force bosons $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^{0}$, and the hadronic corrections from interactions with hadrons: 
		\begin{align}
            a_{\mu}^{\text{SM}} = a_{\mu}^{\text{QED}} + a_{\mu}^{\text{EW}} + a_{\mu}^{\text{Had}}
		\end{align}

\subsection{QED}
\label{subsec:QED}

The QED contributions to \amu stem solely from loops with virtual leptons and photons. They are very well understood and have been calculated to very high order, having been calculated up to five-loop level from over 12,000 Feynman diagrams. This has been done with both analytical and numerical methods. The first couple of diagrams including the Dirac $g = 2$ and Schwinger diagrams are shown in \figref{fig:QEDDiagrams}. The value is \cite{Kinoshita1,Kinoshita2}
		\begin{equation}
		\begin{aligned}
            a_{\mu}^{\text{QED}} &= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} C_{n} \Big( \frac{\alpha}{\pi} \Big)^{n}, \\
            					 &= (\QEDamu \pm \QEDamuErr) \times 10^{-10},
		\end{aligned}
		\end{equation}
where in the first line $a_{\mu}^{\text{QED}}$ is expressed as a perturbative expansion in the fine structure constant, and the value comes from the expansion up to $n=5$. $C_{1} = 1/2$ is the Schwinger result mentioned previously stemming from the diagram shown in \figref{fig:Schwinger}. Over 99\% of the value of \amu comes from the QED sector, but the error is much smaller than the other contributions.


\subsection{Electroweak}
\label{subsec:Electroweak}

The electroweak contributions to \amu are known to two-loop level, with some three-loop parts estimated. The contributions stem from couplings with the heavy weak gauge bosons. The different one loop diagrams are shown in \figref{fig:EWDiagrams}. Per usual Feynman rules, the propagators will contain the masses of the interacting bosons, while the kinematics will contain the masses of the leptons. For calculations of a muon in the case of \figref{fig:Z0Coupling}, these result in a factor $\sim(m_{\mu}/m_{Z^{0}})^{2}$. Because the mass of the gauge bosons are so much more than the muon, these processes are necessarily suppressed and the electroweak contributions to \amu are small. For this reason knowing these contributions only up to two loop level is sufficient. To this degree of accuracy, the value of the electroweak contributions is \cite{EW1,EW2}
		\begin{align}
            a_{\mu}^{\text{EW}} = (\EWamu \pm \EWamuErr) \times 10^{-10},
		\end{align}
with improvements having been made recently. Again the error on these contributions is small compared to the hadronic contributions discussed next, as well as the experimental uncertainty.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Hadronic}
\label{subsec:Hadronic}

The hadronic contributions to \amu arise from interactions with virtual hadrons. Because they cannot be calculated perturbatively at low energies, due to the nature of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), these calculations comprise the dominant uncertainty in the SM calculation. This makes their error estimation extra important when comparing to experiment. Most active work on \amu in the theoretical community is in this sector. These contributions can be separated into two parts:
		\begin{align}
            a_{\mu}^{\text{Had}} = a_{\mu}^{\text{HVP}} + a_{\mu}^{\text{HLbL}}
		\end{align}


\subsection*{Hadronic Vacuum Polarization}
\label{subsec:HVP}

The first of these hadronic contribution parts is the hadronic vacuum polarization part (HVP), the first order diagram of which is shown in \figref{fig:HVP1}. There are two main prescriptions for calculating these contributions. The first is to use a dispersive approach to introduce a virtual hadron bubble into the integral calculation for the photon propagator\footnote{The details of dispersion theory will not be described here but a pedagogical introduction is given in \refref{dispersion}.}, and then utilize the optical theorem to relate the imaginary part of that propagator to the total cross-section of electron-positron annihilation to hadrons \cite{Jeger}. While this could be solved perturbatively for a lepton bubble in place of the hadron bubble, this is instead a data driven approach when considering non-perturbative QCD. The leading order contribution can be written as 
		\begin{align}
            a_{\mu}^{\text{HVP;LO}} = \Big(\frac{\alpha m_{\mu}}{3\pi}\Big)^{2} \int_{m_{\pi}^{2}}^{\infty} \frac{ds}{s^{2}} K(s) R(s)
		\end{align}
where $K(s)$ is some calculable kinematic factor, and $R(s)$ is a ratio of cross-sections
		\begin{align}
            R(s) = \frac{\sigma(e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow \text{hadrons})}{\sigma(e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-})}.
		\end{align}
The cross-section data for this relation has been measured in different energy ranges by various experiments, including KLOE, CLEO, BaBar, and BESIII \cite{KLOE,CLEO,BaBar,BESIII}. The analysis by Keshavarzi et al. \cite{Keshavarzi:2018mgv} gives results as 
		\begin{equation}
		\begin{aligned}
            a_{\mu}^{\text{HVP;LO}} &= (\HVPLOamu \pm \HVPLOamuErr) \times 10^{-10}, \\
            a_{\mu}^{\text{HVP;NLO}} &= (\HVPNLOamu \pm \HVPNLOamuErr) \times 10^{-10}, 
		\end{aligned}
		\end{equation}
where $a_{\mu}^{\text{HVP;NLO}}$ is the next-to-leading order calculation. This evaluation is consistent with Davier et al. \cite{HVP2}.

\label{fig:HVP}
\end{figure}



The second prescription to estimating the HVP contributions is a first principles approach, using lattice QCD and QED. It is a gauge theory defined on a matrix of points in time and space. Once the matrix is taken infinitely large with the spacing between the points infinitely small, the behavior from a continuous theory is recovered. The results for the leading order estimates of $a_{\mu}^{\text{HVP;LO}}$ are consistent with those provided above, though the error is larger. If the calculation is supplemented with the cross-section data described above, then this method provides the most precise determination of $a_{\mu}^{\text{HVP;LO}}$ \cite{Lattice}.



\subsection*{Hadronic Light-by-Light}
\label{subsec:HLbL}

The second of these hadronic contribution parts is a higher order four-photon interaction, termed hadronic light-by-light (HLbL). Diagrams are shown in \figref{fig:HLbL}. Again perturbation theory is unable to assist in the calculation of these contributions. For a long time the calculation of these diagrams was model dependent, and has therefore been the most contentious part of the SM calculation. In more recent years, there have been efforts to produce results using dispersive \cite{Colangelo:2014dfa,Colangelo:2015ama,Colangelo:2017qdm} and lattice approaches \cite{Blum:2015gfa,Blum:2016lnc,Blum:2017cer}. A cumulative report on recent progress is given by N. Asmussen et al. \cite{HLbL1}. The error on this contribution is large due to these various approaches, comparable to that of the $a_{\mu}^{\text{HVP;LO}}$ term, even though the size of this contribution is small. The value of the HLbL contributions to \amu given by Nyffeler \cite{Nyffeler:2016gnb} comes from model estimates and is 
		\begin{align}
            a_{\mu}^{\text{HLbL}} = (\HLbLamu \pm \HLbLamuErr) \times 10^{-10}.
		\end{align}

\subsection{Combined Standard Model value}

The sum of the \amu contributions listed here is \cite{Kinoshita1,Kinoshita2,EW1,EW2,Keshavarzi:2018mgv,Nyffeler:2016gnb}
		\begin{equation}
		\begin{aligned}
            a_{\mu}^{\text{SM}} &= a_{\mu}^{\text{QED}} + a_{\mu}^{\text{EW}} + a_{\mu}^{\text{Had}}, \\
			&= (\SMamu \pm \SMamuErr) \times 10^{-10}.
		\end{aligned}
		\end{equation}
The relative uncertainty of this result is 307 parts per billion (ppb). Other analyses with different values for the various contributions typically agree well, as shown on the left side of \figref{fig:AlexKPaperComparison}. In general the consistency of the theory has been stable for almost ten years now. Depending on which calculations are used, the discrepancy between theory and experiment ranges between \SIrange{3}{4}{} standard deviations. The latest experimental result is described in the following section.

\section{Experimental value of \amu and discrepancy with \texorpdfstring{$a_{\mu}^{\text{SM}}$}{amusm}}
\label{sec:Background}


The theoretical contributions to \amu listed in the previous sections have improved over time as methods have matured and more experimental data has been gathered. Similarly, work on the direct experimental measurement of \amu has been going on for decades, with more precise results being determined over time \cite{PastExperiments}. The most recent experiment to measure \gmtwo was the Brookhaven Muon \gmtwo Experiment (E821) held at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in 2001 . That experiment measured a value for \amu of \cite{E821FinalReport}
		\begin{align}
            a_{\mu}^{\text{Exp}} = (11659208.0 \pm 6.3) \times 10^{-10},
		\end{align}
which corresponds to a 540 ppb relative uncertainty. Note that the uncertainty of the experimental measurement is comparable to that of the theory, necessitating precise understanding of all the different theoretical parts. The difference between the experimental and theoretical values here is
		\begin{align}
            a_{\mu}^{\text{Exp}} - a_{\mu}^{\text{SM}} = (27.74 \pm 7.25) \times 10^{-10},
		\end{align}
corresponding to a discrepancy of 3.83 standard deviations from 0.



\section{Beyond the Standard Model and the purpose of E989}
\label{sec:BSM}


While the discrepancy between experiment and theory might be attributed to miscalculations in the theory or systematic errors in the E821 experiment, no such errors have been found despite repeated attempts to resolve the two. Indeed the discrepancy has only grown over time as the theoretical calculations have matured. The most intriguing and exciting source of the discrepancy would be physics beyond the standard model (BSM), \figref{fig:BSM}. Since the value of \amu receives contributions from all particles that couple to the muon through virtual loops, unknown particles might be the source of this discrepancy. Specifically, since the contribution to the magnetic moment from heavy virtual particles goes as 
		\begin{align}
            a \sim \frac{m^{2}}{\Lambda^{2}},
		\end{align}
where $\Lambda$ is the mass scale of the new physics and $m$ the mass of the lepton in question, the sensitivity of the muon as compared to the electron to large mass scales is $ m_{\mu}^{2} / m_{e}^{2} \approx 43,000$ times greater. For this reason, it is possible that even though the g-factor of the electron has been measured extraordinarily precisely, to .26 parts per trillion (ppt) corresponding to a .23 ppb relative uncertainty in $a_{e}$ \cite{ElectronMDM,CODATA}, it has not yielded a definitive difference between theory and experiment, whereas the magnetic moment of the muon might do so\footnote{A recent measurement of the fine structure constant $\alpha$ to the highest precision yet \cite{finestructureBerkeley} has yielded a new value of $a_{e}$ for which the difference between theory and experiment is 2.5 standard deviations, but with the opposite sign as compared to \amu.}.

Because the discrepancy from the previous experiment was not at the 5 standard deviation level necessary to classify it as a discovery, the E989 experiment was undertaken. Indeed with the lack of new physics results coming out of the LHC and other experiments, E989 is especially positioned to uncover something new at a time where there are so few hints of new physics. Because of this, the interest in the E821 experiment and underway E989 experiment has only grown over time. The number of citations for the E821 results has been consistently for 20 years as shown in \figref{fig:E821Citations}.

The E989 experiment has the goal of measuring \amu to 140 ppb over the course of several years. This would be a factor of four improvement over the E821 result stemming from a twenty times increase in statistics, which was the limiter in the previous experiment. Assuming the same central value for \amu is obtained, this would push the statistical significance of the discrepancy over the five standard deviation mark to approximately seven standard deviations, as shown in \figref{fig:AlexKPaperComparison}. The data comprising Run 1, gathered between April and July of 2018, is the subject of this thesis, and corresponds to a statistical uncertainty comparable to the E821 result. When it's all said and done, the possibility is that we will measure something new and exciting. Even if we do not however, it is valuable in itself to resolve this theoretical and experimental conflict.
