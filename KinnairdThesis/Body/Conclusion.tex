\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chapter:Conclusion}



-calculate what the final weighted statistical error will be approximately

-potentially mention further ongoing dqc work to clean up the datasets before publication
-mention the datasets are not quite final - mention lowkick

-give preliminary values for the e field and pitch correction numbers

-quote the mean R values for the different datasets along with the systematic and statistical errors

-should maybe do what aaron did and give a number for the expected magnetic field error and then the error on a mu

-have a table with the statistical and systematic errors side by side
