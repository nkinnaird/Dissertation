\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chapter:Conclusion}

\textbf{Originally the last section of my w\_a chapter was in the conclusions. Now I'm going to go back and summarize the the whole disseration here - brief summary of experiment, tracking results, and then w\_a. Then the paragraph down below.}



The expected error in the magnetic field measurement for Run~1 is $\mathcal{O}(\SI{140}{ppb})$. That combined with the total precession frequency error determined in this analysis would result in an error on \amu of $\mathcal{O}(\SI{500}{ppb})$, improving upon the uncertainty in the E821 measurement of \SI{540}{ppb}. For the final Run~1 production datasets with the last DQC cuts and gain improvements, the final errors are expected to be improved upon slightly. An independent measurement of \amu that is statistically consistent with the E821 result would go a long way towards increasing the confidence in the discrepancy between theory and experiment of nearly four standard deviations. The Run~1 publication is expected to be complete in the spring of 2020. Data has already been gathered for Run~2 of E989 and Run~3 will begin in the late fall of 2019, with Run~4 planned for 2021. With the rate improvements seen in Run~2 and the expected increases for Run~3 and Run~4, the target uncertainty goal of \SI{140}{ppb} is a likely reality.
