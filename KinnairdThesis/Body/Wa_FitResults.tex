\section{Fit results}
\label{sec:fit_results}


\figref{fig:moduloPlots} shows fits to the four Run~1 precession frequency analysis datasets. \tabref{tab:DatasetFitResults} gives all fit parameters and their errors. In each dataset case the \chisq/NDF is acceptable as evidenced by the p-value included in the table results. Fit pulls and the FFT of the fit residuals for the 60h dataset are provided in Figure~\ref{fig:fitResiduals_60h}. As shown all structure has been eliminated within the fit residuals implying that all effects in the data have properly been accounted for in the fit function. The same checks were made for the HighKick, 9d, and Endgame datasets and in each case no residual structure remained. \figref{fig:CorrMat_60h} shows the correlation matrix for the fit to the 60h dataset. The only fit parameter that is significantly correlated with $R$ is the \gmtwo phase. This increases the confidence in the \wa extraction, as effects in the data which might potentially be mis-modeled will only weakly correlate with the final fitted $R$ value. The various different CBO parameters are self-correlated to different degrees depending on the parameter and the dataset that is being fit. Typically either the phases and frequencies are correlated, or the lifetimes and amplitudes. \appref{app:CorrelationMatrices} provides the correlation matrices for the HighKick, 9d, and Endgame datasets.

The \gmtwo phases for the different datasets showed small differences, due primarily to upstream beam adjustments before injection into the storage ring. Similarly, slightly different asymmetries can be attributed to very small acceptance differences in the stored beams. As described in \secref{subsec:lostmuons}, the value for \K was determined and fixed from a T-Method fit to the data. The values themselves don't directly correspond to the level of losses, as each dataset has it's own loss function $L(t)$ which is left out of the picture here.


The CBO frequencies for the 60h and Endgame datasets with $n$ values of 0.108 were found to be 2.338 and 2.339 rad/\mus{} respectively, corresponding to approximately \SI{0.37}{MHz}. For the HighKick and 9d datasets with $n$ values of 0.120, the CBO frequencies were found to be 2.559 and 2.615 rad/\mus{} respectively, corresponding to approximately \SI{0.415}{MHz}. These frequencies correspond to the expected frequencies as described in \secref{sec:muonbeamdynamics}, with some slight deviations due to statistics and the reduced sensitivity in the Ratio Method\footnote{The VW frequencies, though time-randomized out in the analysis presented here, were found to be approximately \SI{2.30}{} and \SI{2.04}{MHz} for the datasets with $n=0.108$ and $n=0.120$ respectively.}. The CBO lifetimes between the different datasets are relatively consistent, barring the HighKick dataset for which a smaller CBO lifetime was measured. Ratio Method fits typically converge with lifetimes with large errors compared to T-Method fits, due to the reduction in sensitivity in the Ratio Method. In the HighKick dataset, the CBO lifetime did not like to converge nicely in the ratio fits, and was therefore fixed to that from a T-Method fit. The main CBO amplitudes $A_{cbo-N}$ for the different datasets were on the order of 0.3--0.4\%, while the higher order CBO amplitudes were in general an order of magnitude less. The strength of the various higher order CBO amplitudes fluctuated for different datasets, with one parameter being large compared to another in one dataset and vice versa in a different dataset. In some cases, the errors on the higher order CBO term amplitudes were of the order the amplitude itself. While this implies these terms can be dropped from the fit function, all terms were included for analysis uniformity among the different datasets. These relatively large errors, while making some of the fits slightly more challenging to achieve fit convergence for, were nonetheless handled appropriately.



The final statistical errors on $R$ for the 60h, HighKick, 9d, and Endgame datasets are \SI{1.358}{}, \SI{1.411}{}, \SI{0.903}{}, and \SI{0.639}{ppm} respectively. The single seed $R$ results for the HighKick, 9d, and Endgame datasets, all of which used the same blinding string, are all well within $1\sigma$ of each other. The average $R$ value for fits to 50 different random seeds are provided in \secref{sub:randomSeedFits}.


Beyond looking at single fit residuals to evaluate the integrity of the fits, other checks were made to verify consistency. In general this consisted of slicing up the data in different ways and fitting the subsets. These tests and scans included fitting individual calorimeters, modifying the fit start and end times, adjusting the applied energy thresholds, and fitting individual beam bunches.

\subsection{Individual calorimeter fits}
\label{sub:per_calorimeter_fits}


Fits to all 24 individual calorimeters for each of the datasets were performed with the same number of free fit parameters as used in the calorimeter summed fits. \figref{fig:caloFits_chi2} shows the \chisq/NDF's for the calorimeter fits which are nicely spread around 1. \figref{fig:caloFits_R} shows the fitted $R$ values as a function of calorimeter number. Straight line fits were performed to the $R$ values, and the fitted constant returned a value in each case that was consistent with the calorimeter sum fit $R$ values. Examining the $R$ values as a function of calorimeter between datasets, particular calorimeter numbers do not tend to lie above or below the fitted line uniformly. The spread in $R$ values for each calorimeter then can be said to be driven statistically, though it should be noted that with the larger error bars on the individual calorimeter fits it's hard to tell if there are any preferences one way or another.

A straight line fit was performed on the fitted values, with the fit result shown in the upper right box as parameter $p_{1}$ in units of ppm.The different blinding in the 60h dataset is readily observed, along with the higher precision fits in the 9d and Endgame datasets with their correspondingly smaller error bars.}
    \label{fig:caloFits_R}
\end{figure}


Figures~\ref{fig:caloFits_EndgamePars_1} and \ref{fig:fig:caloFits_EndgamePars_2} show calorimeter fit results for the other free parameters in the fit for the Endgame dataset. The \gmtwo phases are relatively consistent among the different calorimeters, barring calorimeters 13 and 19 which lie lower on the plot. These two calorimeters sit behind the tracker stations, implying a different acceptance and therefore a slightly different \gmtwo phase. Any correlated effects on $R$ are not immediately observed, and might potentially be hidden behind the large errors of the fit. Similarly, the different calorimeters have different fit asymmetries, once again due to their different acceptances. The CBO parameters are in general consistent with some spread due to acceptance, with the phases running from 0--2$\pi$ around the ring as expected. As one might notice, the amplitudes of the CBO parameters are an order of magnitude higher than in the calorimeter summed fits. Because the phases vary around the ring, when adding up all the calorimeters the CBO effect becomes reduced. In fact, while it is not always necessary to include the higher order CBO terms for good fits to the calorimeter summed data, there are many calorimeters which need the higher order terms for good fits.

\subsection{Fit start and end scans}


In order to determine if there are any deficiencies as a function of time, for instance if the CBO was modeled incorrectly, fits are performed with varying fit start and end times. If a parameter is incorrectly modeled, it will wander away from the statistically allowed deviation as the mis-modeled effect grows stronger or weaker. Two examples of this are given in \figref{fig:badStartScans}. In general, doing a fit start scan is a very useful tool in the precession frequency analysis beyond just verifying consistency of a fit parameter as a function of time, as it also provides hints as to what might be wrong with how the data is being handled.

    \sigma_{diff} = \sqrt{\sigma_{2} - \sigma_{1}(2 \frac{A_{1}}{A_{2}}\cos(\phi_{1}-\phi_{2}) - 1)},
  \end{align}
where the subscript 2 stands for the larger dataset while the subscript 1 stands for the smaller sub-dataset. This statistically allowed deviation depends both on the size of the datasets as well as their ``analyzing powers,'' which come from the asymmetries and phases of the datasets. For fit start scans the analyzing powers are in general the same, such that the approximation 
  \begin{align} \label{eq:sigmaDiffApprox}
    \sigma_{diff} \approx \sqrt{\sigma_{2} - \sigma_{1}}
  \end{align}
can be made. 


It should be noted that for fit start scans where much of the data is dropped at late fit start times, certain CBO parameters start to become unstable as the CBO effect becomes diminished in the data\footnote{The same applies to the VW effect when not time-randomized out.}. Fits with start times at \mus{100} are half a lifetime or more along the CBO effect, meaning that amplitudes either start to go to 0 or become unfittable. In particular, the CBO lifetime itself become very hard to fit and tends to converge to whatever the upper bound of the fit limit is while sending the amplitude to zero. For those parameters which were found to be unreliable, they were fixed to their starting fit values. These typically included most of the higher order CBO amplitudes and phases, though in some cases they can still be fit out to late times depending on the dataset.


Fit start time scans were performed from the default value of \mus{30.2} up to \mus{100.2} in steps of \mus{1} corresponding to 71 separate fits. In order to assist fit convergence, the final fit parameters from one fit were passed on as the starting parameters of the next. The \chisq/NDF's and fitted $R$ values as a function of fit start time for the four Run~1 precession frequency analysis datasets are shown in \figref{fig:fitStartTime_chi2_and_R}. The error on the individual points in the \chisq plots are given as 
  \begin{align}
    \sigma_{\chi^{2}} = \sqrt{2/NDF},
  \end{align}
where NDF changes as the fit start time is pushed later in time and bins are left out of the fit. The black parabolic bands indicate the $1\sigma$ statistically allowed deviation as given by \equref{eq:sigmaDiffApprox}\footnote{These statistical deviation bands are sometimes referred to as Kawall bands.}. As shown the goodness of fit for the four datasets are all consistent with fit start time, only wandering in and near the bands without diverging.


$R$ is similarly consistent as a function of fit start time. The only dataset for which $R$ goes noticeably outside the bands more than the others is that for the HighKick. Since the deviation is less than $2\sigma$ and it appears to have a trend back towards the bands however, it does not appear particularly indicative of unaccounted effects in the data. In general $R$ is very insensitive to changing fit start time, most likely due to the small correlations with other fit parameters.


\figref{fig:fitStartScan_EndgamePars} shows the fit start scan results for the other free parameters for the Endgame dataset. In all cases the fit parameters only wander in and near the bands, showing that all effects in the ratio data are properly accounted for.

For fit end scans, all of the same methods and conclusions apply. In general fit end scans are both less dangerous and more stable than fit start scans, as the amount of data being removed from the fit is relatively small. While these fit end scans in a T-Method fit might be able to be completely ignored in favor of the fit start scans, it's nice to check that they satisfy the statistical deviations in the Ratio Method as the ratio data errors grow larger with less data \cite{BU60hReport}. Fit end time scans were performed from \mus{650} to \mus{400} in steps of \mus{10}, corresponding to 26 separate fits. As in the fit start time scan, fit results from the end of one fit were passed on as the starting parameters to the next. $R$ values for fit end scans for the Run~1 precession frequency analysis datasets are shown in \figref{fig:fitEndTime_R}. As shown the $R$ values are comfortably within and near the bands. The only dataset where $R$ wanders a little more than the others is in the 60h dataset, however it veers back towards the bands at the end of the scan and is thus deemed acceptable.

\subsection{Energy threshold scans}


Similarly to fit start and end time scans, it is worthwhile to verify that $R$ is consistent regardless of the energy threshold applied to the decay positron time spectrum. The energy threshold was varied from \SI{1.2}{\GeV} to \SI{2.2}{\GeV} in steps of \SI{50}{\MeV} corresponding to 21 separate fits. The fitted $R$ values for the four Run~1 precession frequency analysis datasets are shown in \figref{fig:energyThresholdScan_R}. The statistical bands are the same as those defined in \equref{eq:sigmaDiffFull}, where now the analyzing power part of the equation plays a larger role as the asymmetries and phases of the different fit points are significantly different. As shown there are no major deviations in the fitted $R$ values.

\subsection{Fits to bunch number}


As described in \secref{sec:Accelerator}, eight distinct and separate bunches of muons are sent to the E989 experiment within the accelerator timing structure. If different bunches have different momentum spreads due to how the particles are transported down the various beamlines and injected into the storage ring, then muons might live for different times and therefore their spins might precess more or less within the magnetic field. This difference in \gmtwo phase between the different bunches would then affect the final fitted $R$ value, and might be a systematic error in the precession frequency measurement if certain bunches have significantly more statistics than the others. In order to check if there were any differences in the final fitted $R$ values per bunch, the bunches were fit individually. \figref{fig:bunchNum_R} shows the fitted $R$ values for the eight individual bunches alongside the bunch-sum result, for the Run~1 precession frequency analysis datasets. In all cases there appear no systematically different $R$ values per bunch. When the eight individual bunches were fit to a straight line, they were found to be very consistent with the bunch-sum result.

\subsection{Fits to many random seeds}
\label{sub:randomSeedFits}


While the single seed fit results presented earlier indicate good fits and well understood parameters, it is always a good idea to fit other random seeds in case the single seed results ended up on an outlier. Doing so not only improves the confidence of the result, but also gives a more central $R$ value to quote as being closer to the `true' $R$ of the dataset. Figures~\ref{fig:randomSeedFits_chi2} and \ref{fig:randomSeedFits_R} give the \chisq and $R$ distributions for fits to 50 different random seeds for the four datasets. As shown the \chisq distributions are nicely centered around 1 as they should be for fits to the properly distributed data. \tabref{tab:RandomSeedFitResults} compares the random seed fit results between the different datasets. The means for the $R$ distributions of the datasets which shared the same blinding string \{HighKick, 9d, Endgame\} are statistically consistent with one another, with differences on the order of several hundreds of ppb, well within the statistical errors of \SI{600}{ppb} or greater\footnote{The errors on the mean are calculated as $\sigma_{\mu} = \text{RMS}/\sqrt{N},$ where $N$ is the number of random seeds. These errors come from the randomization of cluster times before fitting, and have no bearing on statistical consistency when comparing different datasets.}.
