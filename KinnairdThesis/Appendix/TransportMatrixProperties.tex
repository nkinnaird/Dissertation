\chapter{Transport matrix properties}
\label{app:transportmatrixproperties}


The transport matrix between two planes (or steps) is the multiple of all intermediate transport matrices
    \begin{align}
        T_{N,N-2} = T_{N,N-1} T_{N-1,N-2},
    \end{align}
regardless of what reference system the matrices are defined in (as long as they are all consistent). When converting a transport matrix from one reference system to another,
    \begin{align}
        T_{N,N-1}^{s} = A_{N} T_{N,N-1}^{f} A_{N-1}^{-1},
    \end{align}
where the $s$ and $f$ superscripts stand for the surface and free reference systems respectively, and $A$ is the Jacobian between reference frames which is defined at a specific point or plane $(A_{N} \neq A_{N-1})$.
