\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter:Introduction}

The prevailing theory for particle physics, the Standard Model (SM), has had tremendous success in describing our universe. It has been used to predict and explain a wide variety of phenomena, particles, properties, and interactions to great precision. However, in spite of its success in explaining nearly all experimental results, there remain unanswered questions about our universe. Some of these include the matter-antimatter asymmetry, the source of mass for the neutrinos, the existence of dark matter, and an inability to fully incorporate our best theory of gravitation. Many particle physics experiments around the world are being devised and conducted in order to shed light on these questions and improve our understanding of reality. One such particular experiment is the Fermilab Muon \gmtwo Experiment (E989) underway at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) located in Batavia, Illinois.

I have been a part of the E989 experiment since I began my graduate degree six years ago. Three years ago I moved from Boston to Batavia to get more involved by being where the action is. This dissertation will describe the E989 experiment and the work which I have done for it along the way in detail. Chapter 1 will provide experimental and theoretical background to the experiment, as well its motivation. Chapter 2 will describe the experimental principle. Chapter 3 will describe the magnetic field portion of the experiment, and magnetic field simulations I conducted. Chapter 4 will describe the straw tracking detectors and their measurements, including the track fitting I wrote. Chapter 5 will describe the frequency measurement portion of the experiment, and detail my analysis results from data taken in the first half of 2018. Finally, Chapter 6 will concluded the thesis and the results contained within.


\section{Magnetic Moments of Particles}
\label{sec:MDMs}

In order to understand the purpose of the Fermilab Muon \gmtwo Experiment, first we need to understand what the $g$ in \gmtwo is. This is what the experiment is measuring. All particles have intrinsic properties. One of those properties is the magnetic dipole moment.\footnote{\textit{Magnetic dipole moment} and \textit{magnetic moment} are equivalent when talking about particles.} This property of a particle is related to its spin through the equation
		\begin{align}
            \vec{\mu} = g \frac{q}{2m} \vec{s},
        \label{eq:magneticmoment}
		\end{align}
where $\vec{\mu}$ is the magnetic dipole moment of a particle, $\vec{s}$ is its spin vector, $m$ is its mass, $q = \pm e$ where $e$ is the elementary charge, and \g is the so called "g-factor". \g is some measureable and predictable constant, which as shown in \equref{eq:magneticmoment} relates the magnetic moment of a particle to its spin angular momentum. Since the torque on a particle in a magnetic field is 
		\begin{align}
            \vec{N} = \vec{\mu} \times \vec{B},
        \label{eq:torque}
		\end{align}
the rate at which a particles spin precesses in a magnetic field will depend on \g. This happens to be one of the key physics principles in the E989 experiment as will be discussed later.

In a Dirac theory, \g is equal to 2 for spin-1/2 particles with no internal structure \cite{Dirac}. See Appendix~\ref{gDirac} for a nice derivation of this result. It turns out however, that \g is not quite equal to 2 even for these types of particles. Motivated by early experimental discrepencies such as the measurements of the hyperfine structure in hydrogen \cite{EarlyHyperfine1}, in 1948 Schwinger calculated the first "radiative correction" to the electron magnetic moment \cite{Schwinger}. In a quantum field theory, interactions of the particle with virtual particles in loops will contribute to the value of \g. In this context it is nicer to recast the magnetic dipole moment formula as 
		\begin{equation}
		\begin{aligned}
            \vec{\mu} &= 2(1+a) \frac{q}{2m} \vec{s}, \\
            a &= \frac{g-2}{2},
        \label{eq:anamoly}
		\end{aligned}
		\end{equation}
where $a$ is called the "anamolous" part of the magnetic moment, and contains all higher order corrections. The first correction calculated to $a$ by Schwinger was $a = \alpha/2\pi \approx 0.00116$, where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant. By measuring $a$, the SM theory can be tested and extensions to it constrained. The measurement of the anamolous piece of the muon is indeed where the Fermilab Muon \gmtwo Experiment gets its name.


\subsection{Why the muon and not the electron?}

The magnetic dipole moment of the electron has been measured extraordinarily precisely, to .28 parts per trillion (ppt) \cite{ElectronMDM}. It has been used to test SM theory extensively, and specifically the QED portion of it. Because the electron is so light, the contributions to $a_{e}$ come almost exclusively from QED. This is because the various contributions from both the weak and hadronic sectors contain couplings which depend on the mass of the particle squared. It is for this reason that the magnetic moment of the muon is such an interesting quantity to measure. Since the muon is approximately 200 times heavier than the electron, the senstivity of \amu to radiative corrections is approximately 40000 times greater than that for the the electron.

-should I put the math in as the coupling proportional to the mass over the energy scale squared?

\section{Standard Model Contributions to \amu}
\label{sec:Theory}


Before experimental results have any real meaning, they need a theory with which to compare. The latest theoretical predictions for the muon magnetic moment will be presented here. The contributions to \amu can be summed from separate pieces relating to different parts of the SM. These include the quantum-electrodynamics (QED) corrections purely from other leptons and photons, the electroweak (EW) corrections from interactions with the weak force bosons $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^{0}$, and the hadronic corrections from interactions with hadrons: 
		\begin{align}
            a_{\mu}^{\text{SM}} = a_{\mu}^{\text{QED}} + a_{\mu}^{\text{EW}} + a_{\mu}^{\text{Had}}
		\end{align}
The QED corrections are very well understood and have been calculated to very high order. The electroweak corrections are harder to calculate, but due to the heavy masses of the force carrying bosons and by extension weaker couplings, are only required to be known up to two loop level. And indeed they are. Finally, the hadronic contributions are where most of the theoretical uncertainties lie, and where most active work is going on. Indeed there are also some data-driven approaches to the hadronic contributions which are interesting and will be discussed in a following section.

By the time I'm submitting my thesis some values will have changed - so I will need to go back and replace the numbers and cite the latest works.


\subsection{QED}
\label{subsec:QED}

The QED contributions to \amu stem solely from loops with virtual leptons and photons. They have been calculated up to 5 loop levels from over 12,000 Feynman diagrams \cite{Kinoshita1,Kinoshita2}. The first couple of diagrams including the Dirac $g = 2$ and Schwinger diagrams are shown in \figref{fig:QEDDiagrams}. The value is
		\begin{align}
            a_{\mu}^{\text{QED}} = (\QEDamu \pm \QEDamuErr) \times 10^{10}.
		\end{align}
Over 99\% of the value of \amu comes from the QED parts, but the error is much smaller than the other contributions and than the experimental uncertainty.

\subsection{Electroweak}
\label{subsec:Electroweak}

The electroweak contributions to \amu are known to two loop level, with some 3 loop parts estimated. The contributions stem from couplings with the heavy weak gauge bosons. Because the couplings to these heavy bosons are small, the electroweak contributions to \amu are small. The different one loop diagrams and an example two loop diagram are shown in \figref{fig:EWDiagrams}. The value of the elctroweak contributions is
		\begin{align}
            a_{\mu}^{\text{EW}} = (\EWamu \pm \EWamuErr) \times 10^{10}.
		\end{align}
with improvements having been made recently \cite{EW1,EW2}. (Double check final value later.) Again the error on these contibutions are small compared to the hadronic contributions discussed next, as well as the experimental uncertainties.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Hadronic}
\label{subsec:Hadronic}

The hadronic contributions to \amu stem from interactions with hadrons. Because they cannot be calculated perturbatively at low energies due to the QCD nature of these particles, these calculations comprise the dominant uncertainty in the SM calculation, and make their error estimation extra important when comparing to experiment. These contributions can be separated into two parts. 


\subsection*{Hadronic Vacuum Polarization}
\label{subsec:HVP}

The first of these hadronic contribution parts is the hadronic vacuum polarization part (HVP), the first order diagram of which is shown in \figref{fig:HVP1}. There are two main prescriptions for calculating these contributions. The first is to relate the virtual hadron production within these loops to real hadron production through dispersion theory \cite{Jeger}. The leading order contribution can be written as 
		\begin{align}
            a_{\mu}^{\text{HVP;LO}} = \Big(\frac{\alpha m_{\mu}}{3\pi}\Big)^{2} \int_{m_{\pi}^{2}}^{\infty} \frac{ds}{s^{2}} K(s) R(s)
		\end{align}
where $K(s)$ is some kinematic factor, and $R(s)$ is a ratio of cross-sections
		\begin{align}
            R(s) = \frac{\sigma(e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow \text{hadrons})}{\sigma(e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-})}.
		\end{align}
The cross-section data for this relation has been measured in parts by various experiments, including KLOE, CLEO, BaBar, and BESIII \cite{KLOE,CLEO,BaBar,BESIII}. The analysis by \refref{Keshavarzi:2018mgv} gives results as 
		\begin{equation}
		\begin{aligned}
            a_{\mu}^{\text{HVP;LO}} &= (\HVPLOamu \pm \HVPLOamuErr) \times 10^{10}, \\
            a_{\mu}^{\text{HVP;NLO}} &= (\HVPNLOamu \pm \HVPNLOamuErr) \times 10^{10}, 
		\end{aligned}
		\end{equation}
where $a_{\mu}^{\text{HVP;NLO}}$ is the next to leading order calculation. This calculation is consistent with \refref{HVP2}.

\label{fig:HVP}
\end{figure}



The second prescription to estimating the HVP contributions is a first principles approach, using lattice QCD and QED. It is a gauge theory defined on a matrix of points in time and space, which once the matrix is taken infinitely large with the spacing between the points infinitely small, recovers the results from a continuous theory. The results for the leading order estimates of $a_{\mu}^{\text{HVP;LO}}$ are consistent with those provided above, though the error is larger, and indeed provides the most precise determination of $a_{\mu}^{\text{HVP;LO}}$ when calculation is supplemented with the cross section data \cite{Lattice}.



\subsection*{Hadronic Light-by-Light}
\label{subsec:HLbL}

The second of these hadronic contribution parts is a higher order three photon interaction, termed hadronic light-by-light, diagrams of which are shown in \figref{fig:HLbL}. Again perturbation theory is unable to assist in the calculation of these contributions. For a long time the calculation of these diagrams was model dependent, and has therefore been the most contentious part of the SM calculation. In more recent years, there have been efforts to produce results using dispersive and lattice approaches \cite{HLbL1}. In accordance with all of this, the error on this contribution is large, comparable to that of the $a_{\mu}^{\text{HVP;LO}}$ term even though the size of this contribution is small. The value of the HLbL contributions to \amu quoted by \refref{Keshavarzi:2018mgv} is
		\begin{align}
            a_{\mu}^{\text{HLbL}} = (\HLbLamu \pm \HLbLamuErr) \times 10^{10}.
		\end{align}

\subsection{Combined Standard Model Value}

The sum of the \amu contributions listed here is
		\begin{equation}
		\begin{aligned}
            a_{\mu}^{\text{SM}} &= a_{\mu}^{\text{QED}} + a_{\mu}^{\text{EW}} + a_{\mu}^{\text{Had}}, \\
			&= (\SMamu \pm \SMamuErr) \times 10^{10}.
		\end{aligned}
		\end{equation}
(Double check this and make sure the correlations in the final result are considered appropriately. I should be able to get a better number for this closer to when I submit my thesis.) The relative uncertainty of this result is 307 ppb. Other analyses with different values for the various contributions typically agree well, as shown on the left side of \figref{fig:AlexKPaperComparison}. Depending on what calculations are used, the discrepancy between theory and experiment ranges from 3-4 $\sigma$. The latest experimental result is described in the following section.

\section{Experimental Value of \amu and Discrepancy with \texorpdfstring{$a_{\mu}^{\text{SM}}$}{amusm}}
\label{sec:Background}


The theoretical contributions to \amu listed in the previous section have improved over time. Similarly, work on the experimental side has been going on for decades, with more precise results being determined over time \cite{PastExperiments}. The most recent experiment to measure \gmtwo was the Brookhaven Muon \gmtwo Experiment held at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in 2001 \cite{E821FinalReport}. That experiment measured a value for \amu of 
		\begin{align}
            a_{\mu}^{\text{Exp}} = (11659208.0 \pm 6.3) \times 10^{10},
		\end{align}
which corresponds to a 540 ppb relative uncertainty. Note that the uncertainty of the experimental measurement is comparable to that of the theory, necessitating precise understanding of all the different theoretical parts. The difference between the experimental and theoretical values here is
		\begin{align}
            a_{\mu}^{\text{Exp}} - a_{\mu}^{\text{SM}} = (27.74 \pm 7.25) \times 10^{10},
		\end{align}
corresponding to a discrepancy of 3.83 $\sigma$.



-double check the numbers here as well later on down the line, values like \amu experimental may even have changed if other constants have changed
-do I want to go into the details of the BNL experiment in any way here?




\section{Beyond the Standard Model and the Purpose of E989}
\label{sec:BSM}


While the discrepancy between experiment and theory might be attributed to miscalculations in the theory or systematic errors in the experiment, no such errors have been found despite serious attempts to resolve the two. Indeed the discrepancy has only grown over time as the theoretical calculations have matured, and no errors in the experiment have been uncovered. The most intriguing and exciting source of the discrepancy would be physics beyond the standard model. Because the muon is so much more massive than the electron, it would couple in a greater way to new particles within virtual loops, or physics beyond the standard model (BSM).

Not only that, but due to the chiral flipping nature...

 A basic example is shown in \figref{fig:BSM}. The discrepancy from the previous experiment was however not at the 5 $\sigma$ level necessary to classify it as a discovery. It is for this reason that measuring \gmtwo is such an important pursuit, and why the E989 experiment has been undertaken. Indeed with the lack of new physics results coming out of the LHC and other experiments, E989 is especially positioned to uncover something new at a time where there are so few hints of new physics. Because of this, the interest in the E821 experiment and underway E989 experiment has only grown over time. The number of citations for the E821 results has been consistently high and is shown in \figref{fig:E821Citations}.


-should I include a feynman diagram of a chiral flipping process? where to talk about this? talk to Lee about the nature of this stuff

The E989 experiment has the goal of measuring \amu to 140 ppb over the course of several years. This would be a factor of 4 improvement over the BNL result stemming from a 20 times increase in statistics, which was the limiter in the previous experiment. The data comprising Run 1, gathered in the spring and summer of 2018, is the subject of this thesis, and corresponds to an experimental uncertainty comparable to the BNL result. When it's all said and done, the hope is that we measure something new and exciting, pushing the discrepancy out beyond the 5 $\sigma$ level. Even if we do not however, it is valuable in itself to resolve this conflict.
