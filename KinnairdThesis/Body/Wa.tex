\chapter{\texorpdfstring{\wa}{wa} Measurement}
\label{chapter:SpinPrecessionMeasurement}
\thispagestyle{myheadings}


The measurement of \wa is determined by counting the number of detected positrons in the calorimeters above some energy threshold, as described in \secref{section:WaIntro}. The calorimeters measure hit times and energies of impacting particles, where these hit times and energies are determined from SiPM current signals and reconstructed



\section{Reconstruction}
\label{sec:ReconWest}



-two reconstructions which are useful to compare, but I use reconwest
-GPUs used to do online processing before any data is saved





-overview of reconstruction

-need to mention gain


-clustering

\section{Histogramming}
\label{sec:Histogramming}


-artificial deadtime

-here or maybe in a later section mention the pileup procedure
